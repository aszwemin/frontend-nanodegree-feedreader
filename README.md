# Tests added

All of the required tests were added. I also added some tests for a feed-container element, which is supposed to display the contents of the article feed links to, rather than redirecting user to the article itself. I have added some functionality in the code (it doesn't actually load the contents in the container, just populates it with test data) for the tests to pass.
